# echo "
#The 1 liner below will:
#
#1. Log the mail queue to /root/mailq.log
#2. A per-account \"count\" is run on the mail queue to determine how many emails each account has sent.
#3. If the account has more than 1,000 emails sitting in the mail queue -- those emails are automatically removed.
#4. An email is automatically sent to support@yourdomain.tld containing the full mail queue (prior to the removal).
